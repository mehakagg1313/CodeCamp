## Contrubuting to Codecamp

- Using your system's terminal, git clone the repository to one of your local system directories
- Open the cloned folder with your code editor( for instance, VS code)
- Open up a new terminal there and type npm i express ejs nodemon. If you get an error, then it most probably means that you don't have node.js/npm installed on your system. To get them installed, you need to head over to https://nodejs.org/en/ to download node.js and once you get that installed, type npm install -g npm in your terminal to install npm globally on your system
- To check if you have installed them successfully, type node -v and npm -v separately in your terminal and if you get a version number in response, then you are good to go.
- Next, you need to type npm start in your editor's terminal to make the website live on your localhost.
- Open up any of your browsers and search localhost:3300 to view the website
